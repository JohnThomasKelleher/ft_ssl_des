cbc works, but cbc with password doesnt.  can compare against my own program


./ft_ssl des-cbc -a -i main.c -k 7004B30DBAE5FA0F -v FCBDA16382DCE8DC

openssl des-cbc -a -in main.c -pass pass:pword -S 5817787817 -p

./ft_ssl des-cbc -a -i main.c -p pword -s 5817787817




everything works**
	   -tests after norming: python script, 
	   -file output
	   - a/not a ecb/cbc/ -e/d i/o all with password
	     -also check random salt by running random with mine and manual with openssl
